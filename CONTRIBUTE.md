## Style Guide

Please follow these guidelines to maintain code consistency:

- Use **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** or a similar code formatter for consistent code formatting.
- Follow the **[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs)** best practices.

  - `feat: added new feature...`
  - `docs: updated README...`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure your pull request includes related tests.
- The pull request should be linked to the issue it resolves (if applicable).
- The pull request will go through a review process, so be ready to answer questions and address feedback.
- Your branch should be **up-to-date with the latest `main` branch** before submitting:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
  ```
